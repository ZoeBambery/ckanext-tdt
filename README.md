# An extension for CKAN

CKAN is a metadata platform that enables organisations to publish datasets.

This extension is a hook for each time when a dataset is added, when that dataset is proxyable through The DataTank, CKAN will automatically change the URL with a The DataTank adapter and deliver the data in XML, JSON and CSV.
